# MMDT_Projects

This template repository is designed for students to use as a base for organizing and submitting their project work. The goal is to ensure a consistent structure that makes it easy to review code, datasets, and results. Students will be required to follow the repository structure and include their code, data, and any other relevant materials in the appropriate directories. The template encourages good organization practices and clear documentation.

## Guidelines for Students

- **Code Organization**: 
  - All project code must be placed inside the `code/` directory. Follow a logical structure and keep related scripts together.

- **Data Handling**:
  - Submit raw data in the `raw/` repository unless it is publicly available or it is small enough to include.
  - Always store processed data in the `processed/` directory.
  - Document any important information about the dataset in the `README.md` inside the `data/` directory.

- **Results**: 
  - Ensure all results, such as figures and logs, are stored in the `results/` directory. Organize the results by type (e.g., figures, logs).

- **Notebooks**: 
  - If you use Jupyter notebooks, make sure they are well-documented and demonstrate key steps of your project.

- **README**: 
  - Provide detailed documentation for your project, including how to set up and run the code, and any important observations or conclusions.

- **Final Submission**: 
  - Before submitting, ensure the repository contains all necessary components, is well-organized, and that the code runs smoothly from start to finish.
